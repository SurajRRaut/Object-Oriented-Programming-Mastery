# Aadhaar Card Management Console Application

This console application, developed in Java, provides a simulation of Aadhaar card management operations, inspired by the functionalities offered by the UIDAI website. Users can interact with the application to create new Aadhaar cards or update existing ones.

## Features

- Aadhaar Card Creation: Users can input personal information such as name, date of birth, address, and contact details to create a new Aadhaar card. The application validates the data to ensure accuracy and adheres to UIDAI's validation rules.

- Aadhaar Card Update: Existing Aadhaar cardholders can update their information through this feature. Users can selectively modify fields like address, contact details, or even request a change of name, following UIDAI guidelines.

- **Data Storage and Retrieval:** The application utilizes secure data storage techniques to maintain the privacy and security of Aadhaar cardholder information. Data is stored in a structured format and can be retrieved for future reference or further updates.

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

This project showcases the effective utilization of various object-oriented programming concepts:

- Inheritance: The application employs inheritance to establish a hierarchical structure, with a base class representing common attributes and behaviors of Aadhaar cards, and derived classes extending and specializing the functionality.

- Relationships: Different types of relationships, such as aggregation and composition, have been implemented between classes to model the complex interactions involved in Aadhaar card management.

- Upcasting and Downcasting: Upcasting is used to treat derived classes as instances of their base class, enabling polymorphism and flexibility in processing different types of Aadhaar card operations. Downcasting is employed to access specialized features of derived classes when necessary.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java source files in the project using a Java compiler.

2. Run the compiled program using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

3. Follow the on-screen prompts and instructions to navigate through the application and perform Aadhaar card management operations.
